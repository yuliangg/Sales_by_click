What we hope to gain from this test
The file clicks.csv contains data about clicks received by Destinia from a hotel metasearch portal during the period of one week.
Some examples of hotel metasearch portals are hotelscan.com, kayak.com, trivago.com, etc. 
If you are not familiar with these portals, please try them out to see how they work. 

The dataset
The file includes the following fields:

date - the date of the click
remite_id - the geographical market of the portal (eg kayak.co.uk, kayak.fr, kayak.de, etc)
checkin - the checkin date in the original user search
checkout - the checkout date in the original user search
adults - the number of adults in the original user search
children - the number of children in the original user search
hotel_id - the hotel clicked on by the user
sale - whether or not the click eventually resulted in a hotel reservation in Destinia

Are you up to the challenge?
We simply want you to demonstrate your skills as a professional machine learning developer by analyzig and creating a model for this dataset:
Derive as many features from this data as you think are relevant
Build a model in R or Python to estimate the probability that given the above data, any future single click will result in a reservation
Suggest any other features not provided above which you think could be useful for the model.


Solution specifications
Use R or Python to build the model
You can use the libraries you want
Provide all comands an steps to reproduce the training and model execution
Provide any details you consider necessary to comprehend your solution
Everything must be compressed in a single file and emailed to jobtests@destinia.com.
